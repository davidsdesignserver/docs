A single part studio or multiple part studios can be used to achieve this, it is up to the personal preference of the designer.</p> <p>Take a slap down intake for example. In this example, two part studios that reference the same master sketches are used: one for the arm base and gearboxes, and one for the intake arm. The following three assemblies are then formed: the base components assembly, the arm components assembly, and the top level intake assembly containing the first two sub assemblies. The base component assembly and arm component assembly are both rigid assemblies with their respective origin cubes mated to their assembly origins. A rigid assembly is one where there are no moving components. The top level intake assembly should then only include two mates: a fasten to mate the origin cube of the base assembly to the origin, and a revolute mate to enable the motion of the arm.</p> <p>The full file tree of this example will appear like so:</p> <ul> <li>Top Assembly: Intake</li> <li>Assembly: Intake Base</li> <li>Part Studio: Intake Base</li> <li>Assembly: Intake Arm</li> <li>Part Studio: Intake Arm</li> </ul> <p>If only a single part studio is used, then there would be a single intake part studio:</p> <ul> <li>Top Assembly: Intake</li> <li>Assembly: Intake Base</li> <li>Assembly: Intake Arm</li> <li>Part Studio: Intake</li> </ul> Images of example assembly Top Level Assembly: 0200-A-Intake. Notice that there is only two mates. The revolute is between the two intake pivot mate connectors, which are attached to the repective origin cubes. Stationary Components Assembly: 0210-A-Intake Base. The components are group mated and the origin cube is fastened to the origin. Stationary Components PS: 0210-A-Intake Base. Notice the intake pivot mate connector, derived from the orange master sketch.  Moving Components Assembly: 0220-A-Intake Arm. The components are group mated and the origin cube is fastened to the origin. Moving Components PS: 0220-Intake Arm. Notice the intake pivot mate connector, derived from the orange master sketch. <p>In order to create a more robust revolute mate for the pivot, start by creating a mate connector in both part studios at the pivot point and attaching it to the origin cube. Then, in the top level assembly, add a revolute mate between the two origin cube's pivot mate connector and optionally set angle limits. By referencing the master sketch for the pivot point, the mate becomes parametric to any changes in either part studio. In fact, there would not need to be any parts in either assembly for the pivot to work because the mate connectors are attached to the origin cubes.</p> <p>Again, the separation of the stationary components and moving components into two part studios for this example is purely personal preference. The key takeaway is that the parts need to be inserted into separate sub assemblies. A simple example of both methods is given in the Origin Cube Featurescript document.</p> <p>This same method can also work for any type of flexible mechanism including elevators and linkages.</p>"},{"location":"best-practices/assembly-setup/#origin-mate-connector-method","title":"Origin Mate Connector Method","text":"<p>WIP</p>"},{"location":"best-practices/assembly-setup/#other-best-practices","title":"Other Best Practices","text":""},{"location":"best-practices/assembly-setup/#simplified-models","title":"Simplified Models","text":"<p>The first advice is to minimize primitives in your assembly.

Best use case is heavy pivots. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>What is Backlash:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Backlash is when there is a gap between the teeth of gears or threads, which allows them to move slightly before actually engaging fully. This results in a delay in the motion when moving, and its extremely problematic as it introduces errors in positioning, affects the repeatability of your systems, and the systems response time is a bit slower. </p> </li> <li> <p>How to eliminate backlash:</p> <ul> <li>To minimize backlash in your system, you need to ensure that your chains are properly tensioned, or use a belt setup as your final reduction. When you assemble gearboxes apply shim tape. In FRC, the hex shafts are not all the exact same size, and this causes slop between the gear and shaft, and in gearboxes this slop accumulates. The way that 4414 shims all their position controlled subsystems is by cutting strips around 1.5x the width of the actual gear, and then apply the tape onto 1-2 faces depending on the tolerance of the shaft.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>How To Tension Chain:</p> <ul> <li>Turnbuckle:<ul> <li>A turnbuckle is a device that is used to attach to two links, and tighten the chain together to keep the chain tensioned. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Idler System:<ul> <li>Idlers are a method to ensure that there is proper chain tensioning, and it essentially either pushes the chain in or outwards to decrease the amount of slack. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Gears:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Toothed wheels that are able to transmit motion and power.

These gears are commonly 3d printed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Bevel Gears<ul> <li>Bevel gears are popularized with the COTS Max90 Gearbox, and are great for transmitting motion between shafts that are not parallel. They cannot handle a high load, and are used mainly for packaging.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Rack and Pinion:</p> <ul> <li>A rack and pinion is a system where a larger gear is driven by a smaller gear, and it is used a lot for hooded shooters like 1678 in 2022.

Eventually, you will be able to just go through this guide to become both proficient at using Onshape and at designing good robots for FRC.</p> <p>Instead of covering random features and tools that you might not use in FRC, this curriculum focuses on using features and skills that would be beneficial to use in an FRC context.

Open Alliance on ChiefDelphi is a great resource on the design and build process for many teams, and has a lot of public CAD.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn more engineering design. Refer to the design fundamentals pages and the deep dives in the mechanism examples pages. This includes how to assess potential forces on parts of the robot, pick the right materials, design rigid structures, learn more about what parts are available to FRC teams and how to use them effectively, and at a top level, what goes into designing good mechanisms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn strategic design. This means learning how to set priorities and requirements for your robot. This means basing your design off of your game analysis, those priorities, and your team's capabilities. This means learning how to design simply but effectively. This means learning how to structure a build season schedule and tradeoffs based off of your priorities. There are many resources for this, including Karthik's Effective FIRST Strategies presentation, Team 1678's training material, and Team 2910's Pop-Up Presentations. Combine this with good engineering design knowledge and CAD skills and most any team can design and build an effective robot and do very well in competitions.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"design-guide/stage0/0A-introductionToCAD/","title":"A: Introduction to CAD","text":""},{"location":"design-guide/stage0/0A-introductionToCAD/#0a-introduction-to-cad","title":"0A: Introduction to CAD","text":"<p>&lt; Design Guide Overview 0B: Onshape Setup &gt; </p> <p>CAD is an acronym for \"computer-aided design.\" It's a software tool used by engineers, manufacturers, architects, and many more designers in industry to bring their ideas to life. </p> <p>CAD is used to create a 3D model from various kinds of steps and tools to help prototype, manufacture, and market a product.

Every object you design in Onshape starts with a 2D sketch within a window called a part studio. Sketches are used to define a 2D profile, that is then manipulated with features.

More on this later. <p>But how do we transform this defined sketch into a 3D object? By using features. In this case, an \u201cextrude\u201d feature is used to extend the profile of the sketch into 3D space. Just like how we defined the sketch, we define the characteristics of this extrude. For example, we must specify a \u201cdepth\u201d or final \u201cheight\u201d for the cylinder. This is used to create the final geometry. There are many such settings we must specify when using features.</p> <p>We can always add additional sketches and features to add more complex geometry to our parts, or to create additional parts within the part studio.

Bottom-up design offers flexibility and independence in designing individual parts. In FRC robot design, top-down approach is favored as system integration is often the most challenging aspect.

A master sketch is a series of sketches that capture the major dimensions of each mechanism, field element interactions, and robot size constraints.

Torrance from Team 254 has provided a list of golden rules for roller intakes. This will also be slightly paraphrased/added to in the intake fundamentals page.</p> <p>General Design and Robustness</p> <p>The main structure uses 1/4\" polycarbonate, 2x1 tubes, and nut strips to attach the plates directly to the frame. In this way, the structure would do an especially good job resisting impacts from the front. Because of the rigid nature in how the main plate is mounted, it can be polycarbonate, making it lighter and stronger than pocketed aluminum. The two secondary plates used to make sure all axles are supported on two points aren't connected with a very rigid structure and so work better as aluminum.</p> <p>The intake is as wide as possible to decrease the precision and time needed by the driveteam or autonomous code to intake the game piece. The only aim is to get the game piece into the robot, then it can be centered or serialized inside frame perimeter, also minimizing the time that the intake is down.</p> <p>Pivot</p> <p>The pivot is powered by a single Kraken motor on a 2-stage MAXplanetary gearbox. The 4:1 stages in the MAXplanetary (16:1) and the 12:48 sprocket reduction make a total of 42:1 overall reduction for the pivot. You can assess whether you want this much reduction on your own mechanism by using an arm calculator, but around 30:1 to 42:1 should be good for most intakes.</p> <p>The MAXplanetary uses a 1:1 belt/pulley to transfer rotation to a long cross-axle. All custom pulleys have pockets for COTS metal inserts to prevent them from stripping. There are sprockets on either end of this cross axle, with chain going up to sprockets attached to the arm. This setup is to ensure both sides of the intake are moved up and down equally so there's no weird twisting forces on the intake.</p> <p>For reducing backlash in the system, the 1:1 belt/pulley is exact center-center distance, and the chains are tensioned with inline tensioners. Large sprockets on the output of the arms are good as well for more teeth engagement with the chain.</p> <p>For controlling the intake position, no absolute encoder is needed. You can zero the position when it is stowed and against the hardstop or have it rest on the ground when the robot is turned on, and use the relative encoder to take it to a specific position down.</p> <p>Rollers and Roller Position</p> <p>The rollers are powered with a single Kraken motor with small reduction of 1.6:1; often, you want rollers to be spinning very fast, but still have enough torque to bring in game pieces without stalling the motor. Compression also matters a lot with this. You want to balance compression of a game piece so the intake can move it easily enough without needing too much extra torque from the motors. This is often why adding grippy material to the rollers instead of increasing compression is optimal.</p> <p>There are 3 total rollers. Rollers often provide more consistent compression than wheels and are a great option for transporting game pieces. They are typically cheaper, lighter, and easier to put on a dead axle than wheels. Dead axles allow the intake arms to be connected by effectively long standoffs, making the assembly more rigid, while still allowing the rollers to spin on bearings. The dead axle rollers used in this project use polycarbonate tube and 3D-printed endcaps for the bearings and power transfer. The document can be found here.</p> <p>Only 2 of the rollers are on the pivoting arm portion. The final one inside the frame perimeter is on a separate plate. This can keep the pivot for the intake arms lower, lowering the vertical height of the intake when stowed.</p> <p>Zombie Axles</p> <p>For transferring power to the rollers, because of the plates in the way and how small the pulleys are, it's necessary to transfer power through the axles (live axle).

Sitting outside the robots frame perimeter, they are susceptible to damage from collisions with the field and other robots. All OTB intake designs are heavily influenced by the design requirements to be robust against impacts and damage, fast, and light.</p>  Always include a way to tension your chains!  OTB intakes must actuate quickly and accurately, so a motor is a good choice to power them. 1678 used a single Falcon 500 with a 30:1 ratio. This intake featured a torque transfer shaft (highlighted yellow in the image) to transfer power to both sides of the intake. Driving both sides of the intake pivot prevents the entire intake from bending under the loads of extension and retraction. The pivot itself is driven by chain on a 32t plate sprocket. Using a chain for the final reduction and power transmission is optimal due to its ability to absorb shock loads.  These screws and washers prevent bearings from popping out during impacts.   The intake rollers are powered by a Falcon 500, and power is transferred using HTD 5mm timing belts. The intake is designed with the \"touch it own it\" design philosophy, and it spans the full width of the robot to make intaking as easy as possible for the driver. The intake is \"geared\" (using belt and pulley reductions) so that the surface speed of the rollers are approximately 2.5x the speed of the robot. This allows the robot to intake balls even while driving into them at full speed. Each level of wheels is also belted together such that they have equal surface speeds, despite their different diameters.  It is important to take the diameter of your intake wheels/rollers into account because it may effect their surface speeds. <p>This intake takes many special considerations to increase its survivability and robustness</p> The first stage of rollers has two belts powering it for redundancy, just in case one belt is damaged. Pulleys feature extra-large flanges to prevent belts from slipping off. Intake plates are manufactured from 1/4\" polycarbonate, which is the most common intake material due to its strength to weight ratio and ability to return to its original shape after deforming. This intake has extra aluminum reinforcement on the areas most susceptible to breaking. Intake hardstopped in its down position. Intake hardstopped in its up position <p> 1678 designed their intake polycarbonate plates to hardstop on each other in both the fully extended and retracted positions. This makes programming the intake easier, and helps the robot pass inspection by proving that the intake cannot extend past the frame perimeter extension limit. In a pneumatically actuated intake, having the pivot plates hardstop allows for some error margin on the pneumatic piston's stroke.</p>"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/examples/1678/#see-this-intake-in-action-here","title":"<p> See this Intake in Action Here </p>","text":"1678 Behind the Bumpers 1678 Match Video"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/examples/clean/","title":"Andrew's Clean 4 Bar Intake","text":""},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/examples/clean/#andrews-clean-4-bar","title":"Andrew's Clean 4 Bar","text":"Motor driven 4 bar intake designed to be as simple as possible, utilizing deadaxle rollers"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/examples/clean/#behind-the-design","title":"Behind the Design","text":"<p>Coming Soon</p>"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/examples/vaughn4bar/","title":"Vaughn's 4 Bar Intake","text":""},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/examples/vaughn4bar/#vaughns-4bar-intake","title":"Vaughn's 4bar Intake","text":"Motor driven 4 bar intake designed to be as simple as possible, utilizing deadaxle rollers"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/examples/vaughn4bar/#behind-the-design","title":"Behind the design","text":"<p>Coming Soon</p>"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/#slapdown-intakes","title":"Slapdown Intakes","text":"<p>The slapdown style of \"Over the Bumper\" intakes is very common in situations where your packaging is constrained horizontally, but not vertically.</p> <p>Here is our collection of slapdown intakes:</p> <ul> <li>4414 Style Intake</li> <li>Washed's Beavertail Intake</li> <li>Low Pivot Slapdown Intake</li> <li>6423 Crecendo Flip Intake</li> </ul>"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/4414style/","title":"4414 Style  Intake","text":""},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/4414style/#4414-style-slapdown-intake","title":"4414 Style Slapdown Intake","text":"A coaxial slapdown design popularized by Team 4414 | HighTide"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/4414style/#behind-the-design","title":"Behind the design","text":"<p>Coming Soon</p>"},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/6423otb/","title":"6423 Crescendo Slapdown Intake","text":""},{"location":"mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/examples/6423otb/#6423-crescendo-flip-intake","title":"6423 Crescendo Flip Intake","text":"This common 2024 design was inspired by the ri3d team Cranberry Alarm.

A failure in the pivot of a design like this would put completely put a robot out of commission.</p>  Robots with lower COG's are less likely to tip and have the advantage in pushing battles!  The main pivot is powered by a custom 2 NEO high-reduction gearbox that is integrated into the A-Frame of the pivot. This is the most important pivot on the robot, since it moves the most mass. For those reasons want as much power as possible here, so two-four motors is ideal. MAXPlanetaries are not rated for the forces expected to be applied in this gearbox, so a custom gearbox is a necessity. The gearbox is placed as low as possible to lower the COG of the robot.  The gearbox drives a Super Max Spline shaft, which is a Max Spline shaft reinforced with an interal aluminum tube. Using this liveaxle takes the load of the pivot off of the gearbox and onto an incredibly heavy duty shaft. All of the Max Spline on this robot is reinforced Super Max Spline, except for the main pivot joint.  Internal aluminum tube reinforces the main drive shaft.  <p>The main pivot joint is supported vertically on each side by 2 angled 1x1 shafts and a 2x1 shaft. Triangles are strong! The A frame is a triangle, and the vertical 2x1 splits each side into two more mirrored triangles. With the plates clamping on both sides this thing is bulletproof. Plates are not lightweighted at the bottom in order to lower COG and because these parts are fixed to the superstructure, so their weight doesn\u2019t limit the rotational speed of the pivot.</p>  A-Frame superstructure side view.   Static triangle load distribution breakdown. Triangles are the only shape which are not collapsable when a force is applied to any side.  <p>The main pivot is driven on both sides by long runs of chain to prevent torsion (twisting of the arm). These long runs of chain allow for inline tensioners to eliminate backlash in the pivot. The maxspline here is a live axle. There are bearings in the blue plates that are constrained from the outside with button head cap flanges and on the inside with 3d printed spacers. The large axle collar in between the two plates prevents the spline from sliding. The second arm section is rigidly bolted to both the sprocket and the maxspline shaft. There is tiny Zombie-Axle shaft with a gear on it rigged 1:1 with the main shaft to measure the rotation of the shaft directly for more accurate positioning.

A unique aspect of the 2022 game was the high goal that robots were required to shoot into. The geometry of the goal led many teams to find that their shots bounced out with high backspin. As a remedy, teams added backrollers to their shooters that were geared to spin in the opposite direction as the main flywheel. This reduced backspin on the balls to a manageable amount, but in some cases left just a little bit. This is due to the aerodynamics of spinning balls; thanks to the Magnus effect, backspin on rapid react balls helped them arc better into the high goal, and increased their stability in flight for long distance shots. Hooded shooter flywheels typically use TTB Urethane Wheels or Stealth Wheels. It is important that your flywheels maintain enough mass to hold a constant speed throughout the shot, to ensure consistent shots. Increasing the mass of your flywheel will increase it's moment of inertia, which in turn will increase its consistency. Games in which you can hold and shoot multiple pieces at a time such as Rapid React and Infinite Recharge especially necessitate massed flywheels. The 1678 shooter in 2022 utilized two SDS flywheels for its mass.
